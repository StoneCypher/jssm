# Lines of Code shootout

FSL's biggest benefit is ease of use, from short machines.  However, it's not
much value to just say that; instead, we should see what the actual difference
is, by comparisons.

When possible, all of these comparisons are taken from the comparison product's
documentation, and are generally unchanged; when not, by following something
that was; and sometimes to add `include` or `require` to make runnable code.
Sometimes details like labels or constancy will be altered to match for
comparison; if so, this will be pointed out.

The JSSM examples are not golfed.  For example, on the states of matter machine,
one could hook all actions, and print from an object whose property names were
the state names, to get that down to two lines; this is the expected "natural"
way to write it, instead.

All code samples are formatted with `prettier` for fairness.

Numbers in bold represent official code; numbers not in bold are examples I
wrote, and despite good faith, may not represent ideal notation.  If the text
is <fail>red and italic</fail>, that state machine library could not implement
that comparative test correctly due to a missing feature.

Libraries are sorted shortest-average first, with failing libraries sorted to
the end.

## Toggle machine

In essence, a simple light switch.  Just shows the basics of making states, and
linking them with actions.

Finity did not have a light switch example.  I made this, following [this
unrelated machine](https://github.com/nickuraltsev/finity/blob/master/examples/hierarchical/index.js)
as a style guide.

I don't format `finity` with `prettier` because `prettier` does an unreasonably
bad job with the oddly nested callback structure.  This isn't finity's fault.

```javascript
export const toggleMachine = Finity
  .configure()
    .initialState('inactive')
      .on('toggle').transitionTo('active')
    .state('active')
      .on('toggle').transitionTo('inactive')

### `faste` toggle machine, 4 lines

Taken from [the readme](https://www.npmjs.com/package/faste#using-different-handlers-in-different-states).
Renamed, bound, and exported the machine result; changed the labels.

```javascript
onClick = () => this.setState( state => ({ enabled: !state.enabled}));

export const toggleMachine = faste()
 .on('toggle', 'inactive', ({transitTo}) => transitTo('enabled'))
 .on('toggle', 'active', ({transitTo}) => transitTo('disabled'))

## Traffic light

Three state, no `off`, no `flashing red`.  Emit a console log of `'Red light!'`
whenever the red state is entered.

Shows the basics, as well as putting a hook on a state (or a node in some
systems' lingo.)

### (created) `xstate` traffic light, 36 lines

There's *most of* a traffic light between [their documentation here](https://xstate.js.org/docs/guides/machines.html#options)
and [also here](https://xstate.js.org/docs/guides/states.html#state-methods-and-properties),
and it seems to piece together into this:

```javascript
export const trafficLight = createMachine(
  {
    initial: "green",
    states: {
      green: {
        on: {
          next: {
            target: "yellow",
          },

### (created) `finity` traffic light, 10 lines

`finity` did not have a traffic light example.  I made this, following [this
unrelated machine](https://github.com/nickuraltsev/finity/blob/master/examples/hierarchical/index.js)
as a style guide.

Finity does not appear to support hooking specific transitions, but instead
offers a single global transition hook.

I didn't format this with `prettier`, because `prettier` does a really bad job
with the chain `.state().on().transitionTo()`; the length doubles and this
becomes unreadable, and that isn't `finity`'s fault.

```javascript
const matter = Finity
  .configure()
    .initialState('red')
      .onEnter(() => console.log('Red light!'))
      .on('next').transitionTo('green')
    .state('green')

Taken from [the readme](https://github.com/choojs/nanostate/blob/master/README.md):

Changed the name of the event from `timer` to `next`; exported and consted.
Reordered to start in red, instead of to start in green.

Added a red light hook with `.on`.

### (created) `robot` traffic light, 24 lines

Robot did not have a traffic light example.  I made this, following [this
unrelated machine](https://thisrobot.life/api/action.html) as a style

Robot does not appear to support hooks on nodes, so we've faked it with hooks
on transitions.

```javascript
export const trafficLight = createMachine(
  {
    red: state(
      transition(
        "next",
        "green"

### `nanostate` states of matter, 15 lines, ❌ cannot implement

`nanostate` did not have a states of matter example.  I made this, following
[this unrelated machine](https://github.com/choojs/nanostate/blob/master/README.md)
as a style guide.

`nanostate` does not appear to support on-action hooks, and does not appear to
pass the previous state when calling its global enter hook.  Therefore there is
no way to correctly implement the hooks leading to liquid - condense and melt -
because you can't tell whether they're coming from solid or gas.  On these
grounds, `nanostate` cannot implement this machine correctly.

```javascript
export const trafficLight = nanostate("solid", {
  solid: {
    melt: "liquid",
  },
  liquid: {
    freeze: "solid",
    vaporize: "gas",
  },
  gas: {
    condense: "liquid",
  },
});

trafficLight.on("solid", () => console.log("I froze"));
trafficLight.on("gas", () => console.log("I vaporized"));

trafficLight.on("liquid", () =>
  console.log("❌ FAIL: cannot tell if melt or condense")
);
```

### (created) `robot` states of matter, 31 lines

`robot` did not have a states of matter example.  I made this, following [this
unrelated machine](https://thisrobot.life/api/action.html) as a style
guide.

```javascript
const matter = createMachine(
  {
    solid: state(
      transition(
        "melt",
        "liquid",
        action(() => console.log("I melted"))
      )
    ),
    liquid: state(
      transition(
        "freeze",
        "solid",
        action(() => console.log("I froze"))
      ),
      transition(
        "vaporize",
        "gas",

### `state-machine` states of matter, 14 lines

No states of matter example was available; wrote from scratch and used [the docs](https://github.com/davestewart/javascript-state-machine/blob/d390627b384b30605b5ee90a70bae713e8b09002/docs/main/usage.md)
for usage guidelines.

```javascript
export const matter = new StateMachine({
  transitions: [
    "melt     : solid > liquid",
    "freeze   : solid < liquid",
    "vaporize : liquid > gas",
    "condense : liquid < gas",
  ],
  handlers: {
    "@melt": () => console.log("I melted"),
    "@freeze": () => console.log("I froze"),
    "@vaporize": () => console.log("I vaporized"),
    "@condense": () => console.log("I condensed"),

### `machina` states of matter, 36 lines, ❌ cannot implement

No states of matter example was available; wrote from scratch and used the
`pedestrianSignal` example [in their landing page](http://machina-js.org/)
for usage guidelines.

`machina` does not appear to support on-action hooks, and does not appear to
pass the previous state when calling its global enter hook.  Therefore there is
no way to correctly implement the hooks leading to liquid - condense and melt -
because you can't tell whether they're coming from solid or gas.  On these
grounds, `machina` cannot implement this machine correctly.

```javascript
export const matter = new machina.Fsm({
  initialState: "solid",
  states: {
    uninitialized: {
      "*": function () {
        this.deferUntilTransition();
        this.transition("solid");
      },
    },
    solid: {
      _melt: "liquid",
    },
    liquid: {
      _freeze: "solid",
      _vaporize: "gas",
    },
    gas: {
      _condense: "liquid",
      _onEnter: function () {
        console.log("Red light!");
      },
    },
  },
  melt: function () {
    this.handle("_melt");
  },
  freeze: function () {
    this.handle("_freeze");
  },
  vaporize: function () {
    this.handle("_vaporize");
  },
  condense: function () {
    this.handle("_condense");
  },
});
```
